# Lesson One: Variables
Setting variables:
```swift
var str = "Hello, playground"
```
`var` is only used to declare variables. When calling the variable, you just need to use the variable name.

`let` allows you to set the value of a variable. For example:

```swift
let str = "Hello"
```
# Lesson Two: Data Types
In swift, there are 5 data types
* String: Piece of text
* Int: Whole numbers, positive and negative integers
* Float: Decimal Numbers
* Double: Large decimal numbers
* Bool: True or False
