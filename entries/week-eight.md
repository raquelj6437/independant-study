# Week 8 Independent Study: Where do I begin?
This has been one of the hardest weeks in the independent study. This has also been one of the most busiest weeks of my life. My last highschool play was actually on saturday so I spent most of my well preparing and rehearsing for the play.

#### Are we starting over?

Arieta and I both participated in the schools play. We realized that we had no time to really put in any work into this independant study. We decided that our original project would be too much for us to handle. We spent another few hours thinking of ways to make this app easier so that we can show what we learned while also creating something interesting.

#### The new and final plan

The new project that we decided to make was Pong. We got inspiration for this game from our p5js projects.
