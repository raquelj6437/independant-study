# Week 8 Independent Study: Where do I begin?
This has been one of the hardest weeks in the independent study. This has also been one of the most busiest weeks of my life. My last highschool play was actually on saturday so I spent most of my well preparing and rehearsing for the play.

### Are we starting over?

Arieta and I both participated in the schools play. We realized that we had no time to really put in any work into this independant study. We decided that our original project would be too much for us to handle. We spent another few hours thinking of ways to make this app easier so that we can show what we learned while also creating something interesting.

### The new and final plan

The new project that we decided to make was Pong. We got inspiration for this game from our p5js projects. We decided to follow [pong tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdL99CH23E8) becuase it was the most straight forward tutorial. In the end, we will add our own flair to it. Probably harder levels or every time the ball touches the paddle, it will get shorter making it harder for the user to hit the ball.

### Takeaways
1. Time management is important because if youre juggling many activities at once, time management will help you to organize your life so that youre not too stressed out.
