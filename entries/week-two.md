# Independent Study Week Two: Choosing An App
Arieta and I decdied to partner up because we are both learning swift.

This week I had two objectives: finishing the [intro lessons of swift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OZ07fklur8&index=1&list=PLMRqhzcHGw1ZqzYnpIuQAn2rcjhOtbqGX) on youtube and thinking of an app idea.

It took me exactly three days to finish the lessons. I completed that goal by being persitant with my work and making sure that my work was productive.

## What I learned
The lessons started off in the swift playground

I did not understand what `import UIKit` meant so I decided to google it. UIKit is the framework that you'll user most often when developing iOS applications. It defines the core components of an iOS application, from labels and buttons to table views and navigation controllers.

Refer to my [notes](../notes/swift_intro.md) to know specifically what each lesson was about.

### Code that suprised me! (in a good way)
Data Types! I was not expecting a data type called double. Float, in most languages usually accounts for all decimals.

## App Ideas
As seen in the readme our four ideas were
* Community Service App
* Connecting perspective college students
* Moodvie
* Party Planning app

Arieta and I made a pros and cons list in order to determine which app we should make. We based the decision heavily on which app we thought would be the most marketable. We decided to create a __community service app!__

Community service app functionality:
* allows for people to choose multiple community service options
* allows imployers to look for people who are willing to do community service
* tracks community hours

## Takeaways
1. Testing code is a very effective way of learning. It allows you to remember the syntax of the language.
2. Taking efficient notes that you can look back on is __extremely helpful__ because you can look back if you forgot something.
