# Independent Study Week Two: Choosing An App

This week I had two objectives: finishing the [intro lessons of swift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OZ07fklur8&index=1&list=PLMRqhzcHGw1ZqzYnpIuQAn2rcjhOtbqGX) on youtube and thinking of an app idea.

It took me exactly three days to finish the lessons. I completed that goal by being persitant with my work and making sure that my work was productive.

### What I learned
The lessons started off in the swift playground
