# Week 7 Independent Study: Crunch Time

#### I’m kind of stressed

Along with my independent study, I am also in a play. Its been hard keeping up with both rehearsal and learning Swift. 

All I wanted to do was sleep when I got home but I knew that would not help me learn swift if I didn't do anything. I decided to learn swift the best way I knew I could so that I could get enough sleep when I got home and also be able to attend rehearsal.

#### How I spent my week

Since rehearsal ends at 7 every day, I decided to use wednesday, my only free day, to try and learn sqlite. I spent some time learning it but only got half way into the video before I passed out. This week has not been my most productive week as I was very tired.

I did learn a bit though. I was able to connect the buttons to the swift script so that when you click sign in it could potentially call the database so that it checks if the user exist. If not, there will be a message that appears that says “username/password” not found. Since I do not have a fully working database, the message will appear no matter what you try to sign in with.

```swift
@IBAction func buttonTapped(sender: UIButton) { label.text = sender.currentTitle }
```

This is how you change the text of a label text when using a button.

Next week, I am still going to try and finish [the sqlite tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4wLS9py1rU). 

#### Takeaways
1. Prioritize your mental health. In my previous post I said this too but it is important that people understand that they’re body and mind are the most important. If you’re not feeling too good about yourself. Then you need to take a me day and take the time to understand yourself.
2. It is okay be not meet a goal. Just change your schedule so that you are able to meet your goal the next week.
